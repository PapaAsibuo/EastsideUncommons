# EastsideUncommons
Relational database application for a fictional rental-unit management firm 

## Description
This is a relational database and associated applications for a fictional rental-unit management firm called "Eastside Uncommons" (EU). The project involved creating a complete ER design for the enterprise, developing a relational schema in Oracle, and populating data. The project also implemented 3 distinctly different user interfaces. The user interfaces were designed to be usable by the customers or employees of the enterprise and did not contain SQL jargon in their dialog. The project included the proper implementation of constraints, triggers, and indices to ensure data integrity and efficiency. 

The file datagen.txt shows all the sql commands used to create the tables and populate them with data
