Papa Kofi Asibuo, CSE 241 Final Project
I used a makefile, kindly run "make" in the root directory to compile and run the project.

Data generation sources:
Mockaroo.com was used in the data generation process.

Rules:
A single tenant is in charge of a lease. They can add roommates on to a lease but they are responsible for paying the total amount of rent for the apartment based on their bank account and card on file
A payment type can be a late fee, security deposit, or monthly rent.

Tenant tips:
To see an example of someone who's late on rent, try these tenant IDs: T_ID = 51425, 73542
To see an example of someone who's ahead of rent, try these tenant IDs: T_ID = 23420, 30100
To see an example of someone who owes 0 rent payments, try these tenant IDs: T_ID = 6139, 80888

To update a phone number try this tenant ID (it currently has my phone number lol) [425-515-6866]: T_ID = 51425

Company Manager tips:
Property IDs with data: 1-30 (use any property_id from 1 - 30)
